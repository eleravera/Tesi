            \item Radiotherapy takes advantage of the damage causes by the ionization of energy loss by particles
            \item FLASH-RT consists in delivering a high level of dose in a small fraction of time: this seems reducing the toxiticy of the radiation on healty tissues
            \item FLASH-RT and the medical applicability are still \textbf{under test}!

        The applicability of MAPS \textbf{would} take advantage of: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item the small C$_D \sim$\si{fF} to have fast readout and discharge, which guaranties a rate capability of \SI{100}{MHz/cm\squared}, to split the DPP in many buckets and reduce the saturation effect
            \item the thinness $\sim$\SI{50}{\um} to have a costant high $E$ to prevent recombination and integrate the signal from many particles
        \end{enumerate}
