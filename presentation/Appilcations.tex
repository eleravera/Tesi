        %Up to 1974 gaseous detector where used for tracking (spatial resolution $\sim$\SI{100}{\um}). 
        The affirmation of the quark model required higher spatial resolution to reconstruct short-lived particles decays $\rightarrow$ pixel detectors start replacing gas detectors for \textbf{tracking} \\
        \medskip
        Widely used for \textbf{imaging} with applications in space experiments and in medicine and many other exotic domains.\\

        Many different types of pixel detectors have been developed:

    %    Task of pixel detectors in tracking:
    %    \begin{itemize}
    %        \item pattern recognition with the identification of particle tracks even in the presence of large backgrounds and pile-up
    %        \item measurement of vertices (primary and secondary)
    %        \item multi-track and vertex separation in the core of jets
    %        \item measurement of specific ionization
    %        \item momentum measurement combining with the information from other detectors
    %    \end{itemize}
