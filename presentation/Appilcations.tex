        \textbf{Tracking in HEP experiments:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item pattern recognition with the identification of particle tracks even in the presence of large backgrounds and pile-up
            \item measurement of vertices (primary and secondary)
            \item multi-track and vertex separation in the core of jets
            \item measurement of specific ionization
            \item momentum measurement combining with the information from other detectors
        \end{itemize}
        Many developments whose main promoters are ALICE (ALPIDE sensor and thinning), ATLAS ITK (study on the Monopix series and on MALTA) and Belle2.\\
        \medskip
        But also \textbf{other} possible applications as in space-experiments and in medicine (dosimetry? Later in the presentation).

            The \textbf{sensor} uses high resistivity p-type epi-layer, TowerJazz in \SI{0.18}{\um}. It is the first large area $\sim$\SI{10}{m\squared} MAPS detector with sparsified readout.

        \end{columns}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item position measurement $\sim$\SI{5}{\um} (pixel dimension 27$\times$29\si{\um\squared})
            \item X$_0$ reduced from 1.14\% to 0.3\% per layer
            \item efficiency of track reconstruction improves of a factor 6 for low momentum particles with $p_T \sim$\SI{0.1}{GeV/c}
        \end{itemize}
        \medskip
         
        ALPIDE is under test for several other HEP detectors (i.e. Belle2) and applications and many MAPS have an ALPIDE-based front end (i.e. TJ-Monopix1, ARCADIA)

        \frametitle{Applicability in FLASH radiotherapy}
        Radiotherapy uses the damage causes by the ionization of energy loss by particles. FLASH-RT consists of delivering the dose in a small fraction of time. FLASH-RT reduces the toxiticy of the radiation on healty tissues

        \begin{itemize}
            \item new dosimeters need to be tissue equivalent 
            \item beam monitor
            \item diagnostics
        \end{itemize}
        Different charateristics, and different requirement. 
        All online detector types show saturation problems at high intensity.
