Pixel detectors, members of the semiconductor detector family, have significantly been used since () at the first accelerator experiments for energy and position measurement.
Because of their dimension (today $\sim$ 30 $\mu m$ or even better) and their spatial resolution ($\sim$ 5-10 $\mu m$), with the availability of technology in 1980s they proved to be perfectly suitable for vertex detector in the inner layer of the detector.\\
Technological development has been costant from then on and today almost every high energy physics (HEP) experiment employs a pixels detector; hybrid pixel currently constitute the state-of-art for large scale pixel detector but experiments began to look at the more innovative monolitic active pixels (MAPS) as perspective for their future upgrades, as BelleII, or they already have installed them, as ALICE.

Requirement imposed by accelerator are stringent and they will be even more with the increase of luminosity/intensity, in terms of radiation hardness, efficiency and occupancy, time resolution, material budget and power consumption.
