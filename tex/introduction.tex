Since the 1980s, when the fabrication of device with very small electrodes (50-100 \si{\um}) became a practical possibility, pixel detectors have been widely employed for imaging and tracking charged particles in the vertex region of experiments at accelerators. Thanks to their excellent spatial resolution, today even better than \SI{10}{\um}, they allow for true three-dimensional space-point determination even at high particle fluxes and in particular for the identification of secondary vertices of short-lived particles such as $\tau$ and B mesons.
Requirement imposed by accelerator are stringent and they will become even more with the increase of luminosity; in this scenario CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are being developed to improve the performance of the hybrid pixel detectors, which currently constitute the state-of-art for large scale pixel detector, in particular by reducing the amount of material, power consumption and pixel dimension.

Experiments such as ALICE at LHC and STAR at RHIC have already introduced the CMOS MAPS technology in their detectors. ALICE Tracking System (ITS2), upgraded during the LHC long shut down in 2019-20, was the first large-area ($\sim$10 \si{m^2}) silicon vertex detector based on CMOS MAPS. Thanks to the reduction of the material budget, ITS2, which uses the ALPIDE chip developed by ALICE collaboration, obtained an amazing improvement both in the position measurement and in the momentum resolution, improving the efficiency of track reconstruction for particle with very low transverse momentum (by a factor 6 at $p_{T}\sim$ 0.1 \si{GeV/c}).
Further advancements in CMOS MAPS technology are being aggressively pursued for the ALICE ITS3 and the Belle II vertex detector upgrades (both foreseen around 2026-27) and by the R$\&$D53 collaboration for the upgrade at HL-LHC, with the goals of further reducing the sensor thickness and improving the readout speed of the devices, while keeping power consumption at a minimum.

Beside tracking, the development of pixel detectors is a very active field with many applications: a noteworthy example of detector originally used in particle physics, and later employed mainly for medical imaging, but also in space and for art authentication, is Medipix, a hybrid system developed at CERN within the Medipix collaboration.
Among medical applications, a possible use of CMOS MAPS could be in dosimetry: in the last few years the search of radiotherapy oncological treatments with high intensity beams (FLASH mode) is requiring new dosimeters, both for the therapies as well as new beam-monitors (especially for focused very high energy electron beams), which are capable of deal with extreme dose rate (up to 40 \si{Gy/s}).

I've studied the characteristics of two ALPIDE-like CMOS MAPS chips and tested them under different front end configuration. The first chip, the TJ-Monopix1 from the Monopix series, is a TowerJazz MAPS fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology and is one of the prototypes for the Belle II vertex detector upgrade. The second chip, called Main Demonstrator-1, is produced by LFoundry in 110 nm CMOS technology and designed by the ARCADIA (Advanced Readout CMOS Architectures with Depleted Integrated sensor Arrays) group; it is intended to be a general purpose device with possible use in medical scanners, space experiments, future lepton colliders and also possibly X-ray applications with thick substrates.  
The main differences between the two chips are in the output signal type and in the readout sequence of the matrix. Concerning the former point while TJ-Monopix1 returns an analog output information, that is the time over threshold of the pulse which can be related with the charge released by the particle in the , MD1 returns only a digital information if a hit has been; regarding the latter, instead, TJ-Monopix1 has a completelly sequential readout, while MD1 grossly combines the information of the hits in order to reduce the data trasmission time and reduce the dead time.

I have set up two test systems for the two chips in the INFN clean laboratories and characterized the devices electrically and with radioactive sources. 
In particular I have performed the characterization of the chips to find the threshold and noise of the pixels and their dispersion across the matrix, to have an absolute value in electrons of the signal recorded by TJ-Monopix1, I've also performed an absolute calibration using a Fe55 x-ray source and studied the dead time and the readout properties. 
Moreover, I've also test TJ-Monopix1 at high dose rate with the FLASH-accelerator recently installed at Santa Chiara hospital in Pisa, and I have participated in the design of the setup needed for test beam measurement.
